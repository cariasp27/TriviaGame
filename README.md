## Gameplay
The questions will appear in the same order every play (changing this is something in the ICEBOX) allowing players to learn and get better each attempt. Players have 10 seconds to answer each question. If the question is answered wrong or time expires the correct answer is displayed briefly and the next question is displayed. This was built for the Case Western Reserve Coding Bootcamp.
